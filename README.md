I have created a simple RsvpService(`rsvp.ts`) that accepts a list of players and their RSVP statuses.

### Functionality:
- Capable of adding and updating a player's RSVP  
- Getting a list of all confirmed attendees  
- Counting and returning the number of total, confirmed, and declined responses  

I have also made a sample `index.ts` file to demonstrate how the service works.

You can run it by doing:

npm run start

This will display example output directly in the console, showing how RSVP data is handled and logged.
